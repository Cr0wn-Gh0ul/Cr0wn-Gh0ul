# The Signal
You haul a beige relic out of an abandoned office, dust in the vents, a coffee ring fossilized on its case. It's a Commodore 64, the once faithful terminal of a NASA communications researcher, late 1980s. Since then, the world traded rockets for ration lines. Budgets died, launch pads rusted, and the sky went quiet. Space became a luxury; survival became policy.

On your table the machine wakes and the room turns evening blue. The drive ticks like a second hand on a clock; the CRT exhales warm dust. You feel the old future humming, stubborn, patient. This was built for a world that looked up; now it waits in a world that looks down. The keyboard is a chorus of plastic springs; the cursor blinks, steady as a lighthouse.

Outside: generators, sirens, headlines without stars. Inside: a silence that sounds like possibility. Whatever purpose this machine once served has outlived its masters. Someone trusted it with work that mattered. Now it's here, intact, waiting for a pair of steady hands.
